// EXPLANATION ->
// for any state[i,j] ,
// there are two things either i can choose front element or back element.

// let us take example for front -> int choose_front = sum-stones[i]-solve(stones,i+1,j,sum-stones[i]);

// sum-stones[i] => this is the profit that current player make if he choose the front element
// solve(stones,i+1,j,sum-stones[i]) => the value of this function represent the optimal profit that the opponent can make
// hence equation [ int choose_front = sum-stones[i]-solve(stones,i+1,j,sum-stones[i]) ] represents the difference between current player's profit and opponent's profit.
// same for choose_back case.
// As question required, difference in Alice and Bob's score if they both play optimally. So by maximum profit for current state[i,j] we mean, the maximum difference between current player's profit and opponent's profit (that can come from either choosing back_element or the front_element).
